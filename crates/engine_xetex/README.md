- **`external-harfbuzz`**: activates the same-named feature in
  the `tectonic_bridge_harfbuzz` dependency.


## Updating the generated headers

This crate exposes Rust functions to C/C++ code using a header file created by
[cbindgen]. To update the header, run:

[cbindgen]: https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/

```sh
cbindgen --output xetex/xetex_bindings.h
```

It also uses definitions generated by the `tectonic_xetex_format` introspection crate. To
update that header, run:

```sh
cargo run -p tectonic_xetex_format --example emit >xetex/xetex_format.h
```

Note that this crate defines the format serial number that it implements (in
`tectonic_engine_xetex::FORMAT_SERIAL`) separately from the maximum serial
number supported by the introspection crate (in
`tectonic_xetex_format::LATEST_VERSION`).
